    about:
        - As a java software engineer, I am now seeking to leverage solid technical skills and abilities to advance my career. <br /><br />
        - With several years of experience in software programming, I've gained strong skills in coding and running projects. One of my projects was creating an online website which is developed by MySQL, spring MVC, Vue, and Cloudflare to construct the service. A version control tool like Git is also part of it. <br /><br />
        - For my current job, I am working on a big project which is involved several companies. This experience truly makes me be able to get more familiar with collaboration, and manage my energy to keep high proficiency and efficiency on my tasks<br /><br />
